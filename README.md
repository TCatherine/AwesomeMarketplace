## Getting started

First you need install python requirements for server-side project:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run existing server write following from root  repository folder (Windows style slashes):

```commandline
python .\marketplace\manage.py
```

For now there is no user interface provided, 
but you can access server-side authorization api via requests.

TODO: add api reference.
